  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Teenagers spend an average of 4.8 hours on social media each day, which means platforms like YouTube
    and TikTok have a significant impact on their lives. Researchers believe social media has both positive
    and negative impacts, ranging from the ability to form strong relationships with others to the prevalence
    of cyberbullying.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s important to take a comprehensive look at the effects of social media on students. Large-scale
    trends can highlight the opportunities and risks that come with using these platforms.

  <h2>Negative Impacts of Social Media on Students</h2>

  <p>
    According to research from Aura, two-thirds of parents say their kids have experienced
    negative effects from social media. Despite these concerns, many children begin using
    social media at a very young age.
  </p>

  <h3>Mental Health</h3>
  <p>
    The U.S. Surgeon General has reported that excessive social media use can increase the risk
    of anxiety and depression in adolescents. Teens who spend more than three hours per day on
    social media are more likely to experience poor mental health outcomes.
  </p>

  <h3>Academic Performance</h3>
  <p>
    Excessive social media use can distract students from schoolwork and reduce concentration.
    Some students spend so much time online that they neglect homework and other important
    activities.
  </p>

  <h3>Cyberbullying</h3>
  <p>
    Cyberbullying occurs through social media, messaging apps, and online platforms.
    Nearly half of teenagers have experienced some form of cyberbullying, which can negatively
    impact mental health and academic performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Body Image and Self-Esteem</h3>
  <p>
    Social media can create unrealistic expectations about appearance due to filters and edited
    images. This can negatively affect students’ self-esteem and body image.

  <h2>Distorted Perceptions of Reality</h2>
  <p>
    Social media can create an unrealistic view of life because people often post only the best moments.
    This can make students feel left out or not good enough. Researchers link this to FOMO (fear of
    missing out), which can harm mental and emotional health.
  </p>

  <p>
    Educators can help by teaching critical thinking so students understand that online content is often
    edited or selective, and sometimes even misleading.

  <h2>Positive Impacts of Social Media on Students</h2>

  <h3>Increasing Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
  <p>
    Social media can help students connect with others who share similar experiences, even if they live
    far away. Some teens feel more accepted and supported because they can find communities online.
  </p>

  <h3>Enhancing Digital Literacy</h3>
  <p>
    Spending time online can help students learn digital literacy skills, such as understanding privacy,
    recognizing misinformation, and thinking more carefully about what they see and share.

  <h2>The Role of Educators in Addressing Social Media’s Impact on Students</h2>
  <p>
    Teachers can help students build healthy habits by discussing screen time, cyberbullying, and online
    safety. Educators can also teach digital literacy so students know how to use social media in a safer,
    more responsible way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Social media can be a useful tool, but students need guidance from both parents and teachers to
    reduce risks and build good boundaries.

  <h2>Addendum</h2>

  <p>
    For this assignment, I converted an academic paper into a web-friendly format using HTML.
    I focused on structure rather than design, since the goal was to make the content functional
    and readable on the web.
  </p>

  <p>
    I used the h1 tag for the main title of the paper because it represents the most important
    heading on the page. Section titles such as introductions and impact areas use h2 tags,
    while smaller subsection headings use h3 tags to show hierarchy.
  </p>

  <p>
    All regular text is placed inside p tags because paragraphs are the standard way to present
    written content in HTML. I used multiple article tags to separate major parts of the content,
    which helps keep the document organized and easy to understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    The footer and script were included exactly as provided in the lab instructions. The script
    automatically displays the last modified date of the page, which helps track when changes
    were made.
  </p>

<footer>
    <p>Last updated:
        <span id="lastModified"></span>
    </p>
</footer>
<script type="text/javascript">
     var x = document.lastModified;
     document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>
